## 1. Introduction
The Automated AppStoreConnect Tester Management bot is designed to streamline the process of adding testers to your AppStoreConnect apps. Instead of relying on manual requests and responses, the bot leverages Slack interactions to prompt users for necessary information and then uses the AppStoreConnect API to perform the actual user addition. This documentation will guide you through the setup and usage of the bot, making it easy for developers to understand its functionalities.

## 2. Getting Started
To get started with the bot, follow these steps:

1. Invite the bot to your Slack workspace using the appropriate permissions.
2. Ensure that all potential users are part of your Slack organization.

## 3. Slack Commands
The bot responds to the following Slack command:

### /addtester [email | first name | last name]
This command is used to request the addition of a new tester. When a user executes this command, the bot responds with a combo box listing the available apps. The user can then select the desired app from the combo box.

On the next interaction, the bot will prompt the user to specify the group to which the new tester should be added.

## 4. Integration with AppStoreConnect API
The bot integrates with the AppStoreConnect API (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/) to fetch information about apps and groups and perform the actual addition of tester users.

When a user selects an app and specifies the group, the bot internally fetches the necessary data from the AppStoreConnect API and initiates the user addition process. The bot handles any errors or exceptions during this process and provides appropriate responses to the user.

## 5. Security Considerations
As the bot deals with sensitive AppStoreConnect data, it is crucial to implement proper security measures:

- **Authentication**: The bot should use secure authentication mechanisms to access the AppStoreConnect API, ensuring that only authorized users can add testers.
- **Data Protection**: Avoid logging or storing any sensitive user data within the bot or Slack workspace.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent exposing sensitive information in case of failures.

## 6. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while using the bot, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to access the AppStoreConnect API.
2. Double-check that the provided email, first name, or last name of the tester are accurate.
3. Check the bot's response for any error messages or notifications that might indicate the problem.

If you cannot resolve the issue, contact the bot administrator or development team for further assistance.

## 7. Conclusion
Congratulations! You are now familiar with the Automated AppStoreConnect Tester Management bot. By using this bot, your organization can streamline the process of adding testers to AppStoreConnect apps, saving time and effort for both developers and testers.

For any questions, feedback, or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the bot administrators. Happy testing!
